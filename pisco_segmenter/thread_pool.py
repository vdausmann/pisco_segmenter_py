class ThreadPool:
    """
    A simple thread pool for executing tasks concurrently using multiple threads.

    This class manages a pool of worker threads that can execute a specified function
    on tasks stored in a task list. It provides mechanisms to add tasks, start and
    stop the threads, and check if the pool is still running.

    Attributes:
        SLOW_STOP_KEY (str): A special key used to signal a slow stop of the pool.
        todo (list): A list holding tasks to be processed by the worker threads.
        lock (threading.Lock): A lock to ensure thread-safe access to the task list.
        threads (list): A list of worker threads managed by the pool.
        run (bool): A flag indicating whether the pool is currently running.
        func (callable): The function to be executed by each worker thread on the tasks.
        max_todo_len (int): The maximum number of tasks allowed in the task list.
        max_sleep_counter (int): The maximum number of sleep cycles before a thread quits due to inactivity.

    Methods:
        worker(index): The worker thread function that processes tasks from the list.
        start(n_threads): Starts the specified number of worker threads.
        add_task(job): Adds a task to the task list for processing by the worker threads.
        stop(slow): Stops the worker threads either gracefully or immediately.
        is_running(): Checks if any worker threads are still running.
